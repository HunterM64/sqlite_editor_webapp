A web app to easily create and edit sqlite databases.

### Planning
> I have data that I want to easily put into a sqlite database so that I can later create an API using that data. I want a GUI interface to easily create multiple tables, edit their columns if needed, and add in any new entries that I need to, and swap between tables at will. If possible, I want to be able to create new database files as well with names that I enter in. Also having a web app to host it on my server and maybe even download copies of the database files would be cool. Written in Java.
